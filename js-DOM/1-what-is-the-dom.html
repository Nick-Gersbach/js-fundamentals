    <h1>JS DOM Lesson 1 - What is the DOM</h1>
    <!-- Notes -->
    <!-- 
        THE DOM IS...

        - Trees of nodes/elements created by the browser

        - JavaScript can be used to read/write/manipulate(add html elements and events) to the DOM

        - A node is just an HTML tag

        THE DOM IS OBJECT ORIENTED...

        - This means that each node/html tag has it's own set of properties and built in methods that we can use to change what's on the web page.

        DOM HIERARCHY

        - The browswer gives us a window object and inside that window object we have a document object. From there we have a root element which is the html tags and underneath that we have the body tag and everthing in between that makes up the web page.
