    <h1>Fundamentals Lesson 14 - Loops</h1>
    <!-- Notes -->
    <!-- 
        LOOP - A loop is an instruction to the computer that repeats until a specific condition is reached.

        - Most of the time you will use loops to loop through arrays.

        - You must always use var or let inside of a loop becuase the values will always be changing.

        - i and x are usually used when declaring loops

        - in general, you can use whatever type of loop you want to get the job done. However, nerds will tell you the following rules - 

        LOOP RECOMENDATIONS

        1. You should us a for loop when you know how many iterations a loop will have.

        2. Use a while loop when you don't know how many iterations a loop will have.        

        3 POPULAR LOOPS

        FOR LOOPS - The loop below says this...

        1. i is = to 0 (i = 0;)
        2. when i is less than 10 (i < 10;)
        3. Add one to i (i++) or i equals i + 1.

        When we execute this loop, it will keep add 1 to i as long as i is less than 10. Once the condition of i equalling 10 is met, the loop will stop runnung. This is a mini app that counts to 10.

        for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            console.log(i) // We log the loop to the console so we can see what's happening. At the end of the loop 10 is not included because 10 is not less than 10. If you change it to <= 10 it would show the 10 in the loop.
        }

           //COMBINING AN IF STATEMENT WITH A FOR LOOP

           This for loop and if statement says i = 0. If i isn't greater than or equal to 10, add one to i until this is true. However, when we reach 4, print the string 4 is my favorite nyumber. When you run the loop it will run 4 is my favorite number and then it will still print the number 4. However, you can simply put continue afrer the console log and it will then skip the regualr 4 and just print your string and go to 5.

        for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i === 4) {
                console.log('4 is my favorite number!');
                continue;
            }

            console.log('Number ' + i);
        }

        //USING BREAK TO STOP A LOOP
        THE BREAK KEYWORD STOPS A LOOP FROM EXECUTING ANY FURTHER. SEE THE EXAMPLE BELOW...

         for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i === 4) {
                console.log('4 is my favorite number!');
                continue;
            }

            if (i === 5) {
                console.log('Stop the loop!')
                break;
            }

            console.log('Number ' + i);
        }

        WHILE LOOPS - 

        let i = 0;

        while(i < 10) {
            console.log('Number ' + i);
            i++;
        }


        DO WHILE LOOPS - These loops are different because they will always run at least once no matter what.

        let n = 0;

        do {
            console.log('Number ' + n)
            n++;
        }

        while(n <= 10);

        //FOR LOOP
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            console.log(i) // We log the loop to the console so we can see what's happening.
        }

        //MY FOR LOOP
        for (let x = 10; x > 0; x--) {
            console.log(x);
        }

        //FOR LOOP WITH A STRING ADDED
        for (i = 0; i <= 25; i++) {
            console.log('Number ' + i);
        }

        //COMBINING AN IF STATEMENT WITH A FOR LOOP
        for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i === 4) {
                console.log('4 is my favorite number!');
                continue;
            }

            console.log('Number ' + i);
        }

        //STOPPING A LOOP WITH BREAK
        for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i === 4) {
                console.log('4 is my favorite number!');
                continue;
            }

            if (i === 5) {
                console.log('Stop the loop!')
                break;
            }

            console.log('Number ' + i);
        }

        //WHILE LOOP
        let j = 0;

        while (j <= 10) {
            console.log('Number ' + j);
            j++;
        }

        //DO WHILE LOOP
        let n = 0;

        do {
            console.log('Number ' + n)
            n++;
        }

        while (n <= 10);

        //LOOPING THROUGH AN ARRAY

        const carNames = ['Ford', 'Chevy', 'Honda', 'Toyota', 'Buick', 'Saab'];

        for (let d = 0; d < carNames.length; d++) {
            console.log(carNames[d]);
        }

        //USING A FOR EACH LOOP TO LOOP THROUGH AN ARRAY - RECOMMENDED WAY OF DOING IT.
        carNames.forEach(function (carName) {
            console.log(carName);
        });

        //MAP METHOD
        const users = [
            { id: 1, name: 'John' },
            { id: 2, name: 'Becky' },
            { id: 3, name: 'Doug' },
            { id: 4, name: 'Paul' },
        ];

        const ids = users.map(function (user) {
            return user.id;
        });

        console.log(ids);

        //FOR IN LOOP

        const user = {
            firstName: 'John',
            lastName: 'Doe',
            age: 29
        }

        for (let y in user) {
            console.log(`${y} : ${user[y]}`);
        }
