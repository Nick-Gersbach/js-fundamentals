    <h1>Fundamentals Lesson 3 - JS DataTypes</h1>
    <!-- Notes -->
    <!-- 
    PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
    - Accessed by actual value. Store on the stack in the variable

    Examples - 

    - String (A sentace/letters)
    - Number (numbers/integers)
    - Boolean (True/False)
    - Null (A purposeful empty value)
    - Undefined (No value given)
    - Sybmols (ES6 Learn that later)

    REFERENCE DATA TYPES
    Accessed in the heap. whatever the fuck that means

    Examples - 

    - Arrays
    - Object Literals
    - Functions
    - Dates
    - Anything Else...

    DYNAMIC VS STATIC TYPES LANGUAGES

    JS is Dynamically typed meaning a varible/array/object can hold many different data types at once. Java, C#, C++ are all statically typed meaning that you have to tell the computer what type of datatype a variable can hold and it can then hold only that datatype. Typescript exists because it turns JS into a traditional static typed language with extra features.

        //PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES (CHECKED WITH THE typeof() method)

        //String
        const name = "John Doe";
        console.log(typeof name);

        //Number
        const age = 29;
        console.log(typeof age);

        //Boolean
        const hasKids = true;
        console.log(typeof hasKids);

        //Null
        const car = null;
        console.log(typeof car); //returns as an object but this is incorrect. Disreagrd this

        //undefined
        let color;
        console.log(typeof color); //Must use let for undefined

        //symbol
        const sym = Symbol();
        console.log(typeof sym);


        //Refernce Types - These will all come bach as objects

        //Array
        const hobbies = ['Halo', 'James', 'bodybuilding'];
        console.log(typeof hobbies);

        //Object Literal
        const address = {
            city: 'Chandler',
            state: 'Arizona',
            type: 'House'
        }

        console.log(typeof address);
